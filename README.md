# planet gravity plotter
This Python script takes the name of a planet as input, and then plots a graph of the gravitational force on a spaceship vs. distance from the planet.

## Physics Formula
The gravitational force on a spaceship due to a planet is given by the formula:

$F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2$

## Prerequisites
* Python 3.x
* NumPy
* Matplotlib

## Installing
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required packages using pip:

```
pip install numpy matplotlib
```
## Usage
1. Open a terminal or command prompt in the directory where the script is saved.
2. Run the script using the command:

```
python planet_gravity_plotter.py
```
3. When prompted, enter the name of the planet you want to plot the graph for (e.g. "Earth").
4. The script will calculate the gravitational force on a spaceship at various distances from the planet, and plot the graph of gravitational force vs. distance.
5. The graph will be displayed in a new window.

## Contributing
If you find a bug or have a suggestion for improving the script, feel free to submit an issue or pull request.
